## #Project 1

This project involved a thorough cleaning and manipulation of a large dataset in order to prepare it for analysis using SQL. We used a variety of techniques, including 
standardizing the date format, separating data in a single column into multiple columns, altering certain values using case statements, removing duplicates using a CTE 
and window function, and deleting unnecessary columns.

Overall, the goal of this project was to take a raw and poorly structured dataset and transform it into a clean and organized form that could be easily analyzed.
